# Haskell Search Engine

This is a simple search engine implemented in Haskell. The search engine takes a URL as input, retrieves the content of the webpage, extracts all the anchors, indexes the content as documents, and performs searches using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm.

## Features

- Webpage Content Retrieval: Given a URL, the search engine retrieves the content of the webpage.
- Document Indexing: The content is indexed as documents for efficient searching.
- TF-IDF Search: Searches are performed using the TF-IDF algorithm to find relevant documents.
